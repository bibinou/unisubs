                In many cases, organizations want to leverage the power of the crowd, but don’t want to leave any chance for poor quality captions or subtitles to appear on their content. This workflow keeps videos private until a staff member has approved the subtitles.

Once English is completed, it’s a snap to request translations from volunteers or staff. We have seen videos translated into multiple languages in just days—through a volunteer crowd.

                Amara is, quite simply, the most cost-effective way to get professional-level quality for foreign language video subtitles. By leveraging professional quality review, you can expect to pay roughly 75% less than the market price for traditional professional subtitles.

Import these video pointers via graphical interface or API, plus we can import a wide variety of subtitle and transcript formats in case you have pre-existing data.

                You always maintain control of your video, because it never leaves your server.  Amara doesn’t require any video uploading, so your existing security policy is always in full effect. We support OAuth, which means your users never need to log in twice—they can see your video and authenticate with both organizations at the same time. Amara makes your subtitles available from the cloud, so you can: deploy just in time via our API; cache on your server and get pinged when there are updates; or use our embeddable subtitle widget.

                Amara’s powerful API allows flexible integration with your existing publishing workflow.

If you use a custom video player, importing subtitles via API lets your company fully control subtitle display and use of the transcript on your website.
